# Note:-
      Following things should must be installed to run this project
         ==>Python 2.7 
         ==>kivy
         ==>Pandas library to handle data frame
         ==>Numpy library to handle array and other scientific calculations
         ==>sklearn for machine learning libraries here we are using SVM rbf functions
         ==>Emotiv SDK premium Edition 32bit version libraries 

# For Data collection and live prediction following libraries are required which comes with Emotiv Epoc SDK Premium
     # edk.dll
     # edk_utils.dll
     # edk.lib
     # edk_utils.lib

Accuracy Achieved from this model is about .60% which can be increased by applying Neural Network and Deep Learning Models
Students or Developers can use this repository as a reference for their project they just need to change grid_searchcv() method in Second_ProcessData.py file to apply different models based on their requirement.
